# Introduction
**SilkJS** is a node package by me, *Silkyway*.
There are a bunch of methods that I normally use that are annoying to implement every time so I put them in a package.
# How to Install
Install by typing `npm i silkjs` in your node project!
Javascript:
```js
const silkjs = require('silkjs')
var whatever = new silkjs.whatever();
```
Typescript:
```js
import { Whatever } from 'silkjs';
const whatever = new Whatever();
```
# Methods
* `silkjs.SMath` - Some math functionality
* `silkjs.SString` - Some string functionality
* `silkjs.STest` - Easier testing support
* `silkjs.SConsole` - Console colors and progress bars
* `silkjs.SRandom` - More random functionality
* `silkjs.SDebug` - Better debugging outputs
* `silkjs.STime` - Better time stuff `(Work in progress, only has one function)`
